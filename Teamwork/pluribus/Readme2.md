## Main Training Algorithm:

Using MCCFR.

By enumerating all situation, calculate the possible regret values for each situation in the game, and then update the probability weights for each action based on these regret values.

Explanation:

MCCFR : Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization

Monte Carlo: Using Random functions to making results closer to the Expected Value

    In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem 
    that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times.
    According to the law, the average of the results obtained from 
    a large number of trials should be close to the expected value 
    and tends to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.
